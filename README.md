# Video-Compilation-Page

A simple HTML project that compiles educational videos about Front End Web Development.  
This page highlights the three core technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and includes embedded YouTube tutorials for each.

## What I Practiced
- Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`–`<h2>`, `<p>`)
- Embedding external media with `<iframe>`
- Writing clear, descriptive text for accessibility and readability
- Organizing related content under sections

## Overview
Front End Web Development focuses on creating visually appealing, interactive, and accessible websites.  
This project summarizes what each main language contributes to the process and links to helpful video resources for beginners.
